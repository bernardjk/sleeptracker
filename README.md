Yes, we are aiming for boomers who are lazy and didnt want to bother to complex guide

specifically for mobiles thus both.


8. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?
there are two ways, the user can click and button to start and stop. if they forget to log in they can also choose to manually log in their sleeps by selecting day and time. this gives the users their freedom to choose whichever way that suits them the best. 


9. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?
The users are given a slider to pick a value, at the same time they can put in notes indicating their feelings. We think this is a good apporoach since it is easy to go through the process while keeping things simple. 


10. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?
there is another tab that user can click on to view the history. Then, they can choose between day and night by clicking the tabs on the top. We think this provides a direct visual for the users and it is simple enough for anyone without tutorials to navigate through this process. 


11. Which feature choose--using a native device resource, backing up logged data, or both?
We choose to back up logged data through local storage.


12. If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?
N/A


13. If you backed up logged data, where does it back up to?
the data is backed up to the local storage.

14. How does your app implement or follow principles of good mobile design?
A simple inital view where the user is promted to start logging.
when the user input something wrong they can always cancel or not input it at all. 
Visually apprealing by having dedicated colors for day and night.
